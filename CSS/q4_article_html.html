                The modern web is built on a foundation of **HTML**, **CSS**, and JavaScript. While frameworks and libraries often dominate the conversation, the true power of a robust website begins with its fundamental structure: semantic HTML. It is the practice of using the appropriate tag for the job, such as using `<nav>` for navigation links and `<article>` for self-contained content.
            </p>

            <p>
                A core principle often overlooked is accessibility. Semantic tags provide inherent meaning to screen readers and other assistive technologies. A `<h1>` clearly indicates the main heading, unlike a simple `<div>` styled with a large font. This commitment to structure ensures that the content is understandable by all users, not just those using a visual browser. This makes the web a more <mark>inclusive space</mark> for everyone.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "The web is a universal medium, and semantic markup is the language of universality. It's not just good practice; it's a moral imperative for building the future internet."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Beyond accessibility, search engine optimization (**SEO**) greatly benefits from semantic code. Search engine crawlers can more accurately determine the context and hierarchy of a page's content when proper semantic tags are used. This can lead to better indexing and, ultimately, higher visibility in search results. Therefore, focusing on `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` isn't just about clean code; itâ€™s a powerful marketing tool.
            </p>

            <p>
                To illustrate, consider the use of the `<mark>` tag. It is designed specifically to highlight text for **relevance** or **emphasis**, exactly as you see here. It provides semantic meaning that a simple `<span>` with a yellow background cannot. Developers must move beyond using tags purely for their default visual style and instead focus on their intrinsic meaning. This approach separates good code from <mark>great code</mark>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, a well-structured document is easier to maintain and style with CSS. When developers and designers know exactly what each element represents, applying styles becomes predictable and efficient. The cascading nature of **CSS** works best when the underlying HTML is logical and clear. Adopting a strong semantic approach is the first and most crucial step in any web project.
